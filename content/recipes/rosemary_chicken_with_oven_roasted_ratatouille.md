- Cut the {{< ingredient_mention name="aubergine" fraction="1.0" >}} into chunky pieces.
- Slice the {{< ingredient_mention name="courgettes" fraction="1.0" >}} into half-moons.
- Deseed and roughly chop the {{< ingredient_mention name="mixed peppers" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Finely chop the {{< ingredient_mention name="rosemary" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Crush the {{< ingredient_mention name="garlic cloves" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. In a large roasting tin, toss together the {{< ingredient_mention name="aubergine" fraction="1.0" >}}, {{< ingredient_mention name="courgettes" fraction="1.0" >}}, and {{< ingredient_mention name="mixed peppers" fraction="1.0" >}} with {{< ingredient_mention name="rosemary" fraction="0.5" >}}, {{< ingredient_mention name="garlic cloves" fraction="0.5" >}}, 2 tbsp {{< ingredient_mention name="olive oil" fraction="0.5" >}} and some seasoning. Spread out the vegetables in an even layer, then roast in the oven for 20 mins.
- Meanwhile, mix remaining {{< ingredient_mention name="rosemary" fraction="0.5" >}}, {{< ingredient_mention name="garlic cloves" fraction="0.5" >}}, and 2 tbsp {{< ingredient_mention name="olive oil" fraction="0.5" >}} together. Slash each of the {{< ingredient_mention name="chicken breasts" fraction="1.0" >}} 4-5 times with a sharp knife, brush over the flavoured oil, season and chill for 15 mins.
- After vegetables have cooked for 20 mins, stir in the {{< ingredient_mention name="cherry tomatoes" fraction="1.0" >}}. Make spaces in the roasting tin and nestle the {{< ingredient_mention name="chicken breasts" fraction="1.0" >}} amongst the vegetables. Place a {{< ingredient_mention name="sprigs rosemary" fraction="1.0" >}} on top of each {{< ingredient_mention name="chicken breasts" fraction="1.0" >}}. Return the tin to the oven for 18-20 mins, until the {{< ingredient_mention name="chicken breasts" fraction="1.0" >}} are cooked through and the vegetables are lightly caramelised.
- Serve with some new potatoes, if you like.
