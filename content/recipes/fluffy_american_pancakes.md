- Lightly beat {{< ingredient_mention name="egg" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Melt {{< ingredient_mention name="butter" fraction="1.0" >}} and allow to cool slightly.
- Sift {{< ingredient_mention name="plain flour" fraction="1.0" >}}, {{< ingredient_mention name="baking powder" fraction="1.0" >}}, {{< ingredient_mention name="salt" fraction="1.0" >}}, and {{< ingredient_mention name="caster sugar" fraction="1.0" >}} into a large bowl.
- In a separate bowl or jug, lightly whisk together {{< ingredient_mention name="milk" fraction="1.0" >}} and {{< ingredient_mention name="egg" fraction="1.0" >}}, then whisk in the melted {{< ingredient_mention name="melted butter" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing.
- Let the batter stand for a few minutes.
- Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of {{< ingredient_mention name="butter" fraction="0.1" >}}.
- When it's melted, add a ladle of batter (or two if your frying pan is big enough to cook two pancakes at the same time).
- Wait for about 3 minutes until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, and the edges begin to set.
- Flip it over and cook for another two minutes until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm/Â½in thick.
- If the pancake is too dark, reduce the heat slightly for the next round.
- Repeat until all the batter is used up.
- Serve with lashings of real {{< ingredient_mention name="maple syrup" fraction="1.0" >}} and extra {{< ingredient_mention name="butter" fraction="0.9" >}}, if you like.
