- Chop the {{< ingredient_mention name="onion" fraction="1.0" >}} and {{< ingredient_mention name="carrots" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Heat 1 tbsp {{< ingredient_mention name="sunflower oil" fraction="0.125" >}} in a medium saucepan.
- Soften the chopped {{< ingredient_mention name="onion" fraction="1.0" >}} and chopped {{< ingredient_mention name="carrots" fraction="1.0" >}} for a few mins.
- When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in the {{< ingredient_mention name="lamb mince" fraction="1.0" >}} and brown, tipping off any excess fat.
- Add {{< ingredient_mention name="tomato purée" fraction="1.0" >}} and {{< ingredient_mention name="worcestershire sauce" fraction="1.0" >}}, then fry for a few mins.
- Pour over {{< ingredient_mention name="beef stock" fraction="1.0" >}}, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.
- Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.
- Make the mash. Boil the {{< ingredient_mention name="potatoes" fraction="1.0" >}} in salted water for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with {{< ingredient_mention name="butter" fraction="1.0" >}} and {{< ingredient_mention name="milk" fraction="1.0" >}}.
- Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork.
- The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.
- Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling through at the edges.
- (To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre.
- Flash under the grill to brown, if you like.)
- Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.
